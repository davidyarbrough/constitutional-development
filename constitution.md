# Constitutional Development Constitution

## Core Principles

1. This constitution governs the development and maintenance of constitutional templates and documentation in this repository
2. All developers and AI assistants must follow these rules
3. The repository maintainer has final authority on all changes
4. All templates must promote clear, AI-friendly governance

## Template Standards

### General Requirements

1. Each template must include:
   - Clear core principles
   - Specific governance rules
   - Amendment process
   - Documentation standards
   - Code standards

2. Templates must be:
   - Clear and unambiguous
   - Easy to understand by both humans and AI
   - Maintainable and extensible

### Directory Structure

1. All templates must reside in `/templates/`
2. Each template must have:
   - A dedicated directory
   - A `constitution.md` file
   - A `README.md` file
3. When implementing a template, the constitution MUST be placed at the root of the project as `constitution.md`
4. If templates have supporting documents or directories, their purpose must be documented in the template's README.md and explained by the constitution itself.

### Documentation Requirements

1. Each template's README.md must include:
   - Clear description of the template's purpose
   - Features and capabilities
   - Usage instructions
   - Customization guidance

2. The main README.md must:
   - Explain Constitutional Development
   - List and describe all available templates
   - Provide clear getting started instructions
   - Maintain accurate links to all templates

## Template Categories

### Core Templates

1. Must provide fundamental Constitutional Development patterns
2. Must be language and framework agnostic
3. Must be easily adaptable to different project sizes

### Language-Specific Templates

1. Must incorporate language best practices
2. Must reference official language guidelines
3. Must integrate with language-specific tools
4. Must maintain consistency with core templates

## Quality Standards

### Content Quality

1. All documentation must be:
   - Well-organized
   - Free of typos and errors
   - Written in clear, professional English
   - Properly formatted in Markdown

2. All constitutions must be:
   - Logically structured
   - Internally consistent
   - Free of contradictions
   - Future-proofed where possible, e.g. avoid referencing specific versions of languages

### Maintenance

2. Documentation must be updated:
   - When templates change
   - When new templates are added
   - When examples are modified
   - When processes change

## Development Process

### Adding Templates

1. New templates must:
   - Fill a clear need
   - Not duplicate existing templates
   - Follow established patterns
   - Include complete documentation

2. Language-specific templates must:
   - Reference authoritative sources
   - Use current language versions
   - Include tooling requirements
   - Consider ecosystem standards

### Modifying Templates

1. Changes must:
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible
   - Be documented in commit messages
   - Be reflected in all related documentation
   - Preserve the template's core purpose

2. Breaking changes require:
   - Clear justification
   - Migration guidance
   - Maintainer approval
   - Version number increment

## Amendment Process

1. Constitutional changes require maintainer approval
2. Approved changes take effect immediately
3. All changes must be logged in the AI operations log
4. Template-specific changes must not conflict with this constitution
