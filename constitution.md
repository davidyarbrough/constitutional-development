# Constitutional Development Constitution

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1. Authority

1.1.1. This constitution governs the development and maintenance of constitutional templates and documentation in this repository.
1.1.2. All developers and AI assistants must follow these rules.
1.1.3. The repository maintainer has final authority on all changes.

### 1.2. Mission

1.2.1. All templates must promote clear, AI-friendly governance.

## 2. Template Standards

### 2.1. Constitutional Structure

2.1.1. All constitutions must follow a standardized structure with rules as specific directives treated as supreme guidance.
2.1.2. Each rule must have a unique reference number.
2.1.3. Each rule must be expressed as a clear, actionable statement.
2.1.4. Sections must be numbered categorizations that group related rules.
2.1.5. Lines containing Sections must be preceded by `#` for major sections and `##`, `###`, etc. for subsections.
2.1.6. Rules must not be preceded by a hash; a line containing a Rule must begin with the Rule's reference number.

### 2.2. Numbering System

2.2.1. Major sections must be numbered sequentially (1., 2., 3., etc.).
2.2.2. Subsections must use decimal notation (2.1., 2.2., 2.3., etc.).
2.2.3. Rules must continue the hierarchy (2.1.1., 2.1.2., etc.).
2.2.4. All decimal points must be followed by a space.

### 2.3. Hierarchy Best Practices

2.3.1. Keep the hierarchy as flat as possible to prevent confusion.
2.3.2. Each rule must be a leaf in the hierarchy tree.
2.3.3. Avoid combining rules - if a rule contains "and", consider splitting it.
2.3.4. Sections must only serve as categorization for rules beneath them; they may not be rules themselves.

### 2.4. General Requirements

2.4.1. Each template must include clear core principles.
2.4.2. Each template must include specific governance rules.
2.4.3. Each template must include an amendment process.

2.4.5. Each template must include code standards.
2.4.6. Templates must be clear and unambiguous.
2.4.7. Templates must be easy to understand by both humans and AI.
2.4.8. Templates must be maintainable and extensible.

### 2.5. Directory Structure

2.5.1. All templates must reside in `/templates/`.
2.5.2. Each template must have a dedicated directory.
2.5.3. Each template must have a `constitution.md` file.
2.5.4. Each template must have a `README.md` file.
2.5.5. When implementing a template, the constitution MUST be placed at the root of the project as `constitution.md`.
2.5.6. If templates have supporting documents or directories, their purpose must be documented in the template's README.md.
2.5.7. If templates have supporting documents or directories, their purpose must be explained by the constitution itself.

### 2.6. Documentation Requirements

2.6.1. Each template's README.md must include a clear description of the template's purpose.
2.6.2. Each template's README.md must include features and capabilities.
2.6.3. Each template's README.md must include usage instructions.
2.6.4. Each template's README.md must include customization guidance.
2.6.5. The main README.md must explain Constitutional Development.
2.6.6. The main README.md must list and describe all available templates.
2.6.7. The main README.md must provide clear getting started instructions.
2.6.8. The main README.md must maintain accurate links to all templates.

## 3. Template Categories

### 3.1. Core Templates

3.1.1. Core templates must provide fundamental Constitutional Development patterns.
3.1.2. Core templates must be language and framework agnostic.

### 4.2. Maintenance

4.2.1. Documentation must be updated when templates change.
4.2.2. Documentation must be updated when new templates are added.
4.2.3. Documentation must be updated when examples are modified.
