# Constitutional Development

This repository serves as a guide for implementing Constitutional Development in software projects.

## What is Constitutional Development?

Constitutional Development is a software development methodology where a formal constitution serves as the supreme authority for all code decisions and system behaviors within a repository. This approach:

1. Establishes clear, foundational principles that guide development
2. Creates a consistent framework for decision-making over time, increasing the cohesion of AI-generated code.
3. Reduces conflicts from multiple developers running multiple independent AI assistants
4. Provides a single source of truth for decisions that would otherwise be decided by AI assistants on the fly.

## How It Works

The heart of Constitutional Development is the project constitution. This document:

- Serves as the highest authority for all code and documentation
- Binds both human developers and AI assistants to its provisions
- Can be amended through a formal process designated by the repository maintainer
- May delegate specific governance to other key documents (ADRs, style guides, etc.)

## Benefits for AI-Assisted Development

Constitutional Development is particularly powerful when working with AI assistants because it:

1. **Provides Clear Boundaries**: AI assistants can reference explicit rules and principles when making decisions about the repository, even across user environments (or across different AI tools)
2. **Ensures Consistency**: All changes, whether made by humans or AI, must adhere to the same constitutional framework
3. **Maintains Quality**: Constitutional provisions enforce standards for code quality, documentation, and architectural decisions and may be as specific as they need to be.
4. **Reduces Ambiguity**: Clear constitutional guidelines help AI assistants make more consistent decisions when faced with trade-offs or other ambiguous circumstances.
5. **Flexible and Extensible**: Project constitutions can be tuned to any combination of human contributors, AI contributors, languages, frameworks, or styles. If you are seeing a recurring issue with AI assisted development, a new amendment may guide it more consistently toward the result you want.

## Available Templates

### General Templates

#### [Simple Template](templates/simple/)
A minimal constitution focused on core principles, perfect for getting started with Constitutional Development or building a custom governance structure. Features basic quality rules and a straightforward amendment process.

#### [Constitution with History](templates/constitution-with-history/)
A comprehensive template that maintains a complete historical record of constitutional changes. Ideal for projects requiring formal amendment processes and governance auditability.

### Language-Specific Templates

#### [Java Template](templates/java/)
Combines Constitutional Development with Java best practices, including package organization, SOLID principles, and Java-specific tooling requirements.

#### [Python Template](templates/python/)
Integrates Python conventions (PEP 8), type hints, and modern Python tooling with constitutional governance.

#### [Ruby Template](templates/ruby/)
Incorporates Ruby idioms, gem structure guidelines, and Ruby-specific testing and documentation practices.

#### [JavaScript Template](templates/javascript/)
Focuses on modern JavaScript features, browser compatibility, and JavaScript ecosystem best practices.

#### [TypeScript Template](templates/typescript/)
Emphasizes TypeScript's type system, strict configurations, and type-safe development patterns.

### Development Methodology Templates

#### [Test-Driven Development Template](templates/test-driven-development/)
Enforces strict Test-Driven Development methodology, mandating tests before implementation with a "Red-Green-Refactor" workflow. Ideal for projects requiring high test coverage and systematic feature development.

## Getting Started

To implement Constitutional Development in your project:

1. Choose a template that matches your needs:
   - `templates/simple/` - A minimal constitution focused on core principles, is a good one to build upon.

2. Copy the chosen template's constitution to your project:
   - The constitution should be placed at the root of your project as `constitution.md`
   - For templates with additional files, follow their specific documentation

3. Instruct your AI assistant to follow the constitution, either as a persistent prompt (if your assistant supports it) or as an instruction in a conversation:
   ```
   Please follow the rules in the constitution.md file for all future interactions with this codebase.
   ```

4. Ask your AI assistant to review the constitution to ensure that it can see and interpret it correctly

## For Organizations

Constitutional Development can be implemented organization-wide to ensure consistent governance across all projects. Here's how to get started:

### Setting Up Organization Templates

1. Fork this repository to create your organization's constitutional template repository
2. Customize existing templates or create new ones specific to your organization's needs:
   - Language-specific requirements
   - Code style preferences
   - Testing standards
   - Documentation requirements
   - Security policies
   - Deployment guidelines

### Implementation Strategies

#### Project-Level Implementation
- Each project includes its own `constitution.md`
- Projects can extend organization templates with project-specific rules
- Allows for project-level flexibility while maintaining org-wide standards

#### Organization-Level Implementation
- Maintain a central constitution repository
- Projects reference the organization's constitution(s)
- Easier to maintain and update across all projects
- More consistent governance

### Enforcement Options

1. **Git Hooks**:
   - Pre-commit hooks to validate constitutional compliance
   - Custom scripts to check code against constitutional rules
   - Automated documentation checks

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Constitutional compliance checks in CI pipelines
   - Automated testing of governance rules
   - Integration with code review tools

3. **Code Analysis Tools**:
   - Custom linters for constitutional rules
   - Static analysis tools
   - Documentation validators

### Best Practices

1. **Version Control**:
   - Track constitutional changes with explanatory comments
   - Document amendments and their rationale
   - Maintain a clear amendment process (simpler may be better)

2. **Communication**:
   - Train teams on constitutional principles
   - Decide who is allowed to make amendments (all devs, technical leads, directors and above, etc.)
   - Include constitutional review in code reviews
   - Document constitutional decisions

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Regular review of constitutional effectiveness
   - Update templates based on team feedback
   - Monitor AI assistant compliance

## Legacy Codebases

Constitutional Development can be introduced to existing codebases through a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Assessment

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Use AI assistants to analyze the current codebase structure
   - Identify common patterns and anti-patterns
   - Document existing implicit conventions
   - Map dependencies and architectural boundaries

2. **Draft Constitution**:
   - Start with existing conventions that work well
   - Address known pain points and technical debt
   - Keep initial rules broad to avoid overwhelming violations
   - Focus on forward-looking rules that guide new development

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. **Scanning for Violations**:
   - Use AI assistants to identify constitutional violations
   - Create reports categorizing violations by:
     * Severity (critical, major, minor)
     * Type (style, architecture, documentation)
     * Location (specific files or components)
   - Track violation patterns to identify systemic issues

2. **Prioritization**:
   - Focus on preventing new violations first
   - Address critical violations in high-traffic code
   - Create technical debt tickets for existing violations
   - Set realistic timelines for compliance

### Phase 3: Enforcement

1. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - Start with new code only
   - Add pre-commit hooks for basic checks
   - Implement CI/CD validation
   - Monitor and adjust rules based on feedback

2. **Violation Management**:
   - Document approved exceptions
   - Create automated waivers for legacy code
   - Set up violation tracking dashboards
   - Regular review of waived violations

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**:
   - Begin with a minimal set of rules
   - Focus on highest-impact areas first
   - Gradually expand scope as team adapts

2. **Team Involvement**:
   - Get buy-in from developers
   - Use constitutional reviews in code review process
   - Regular team discussions about constitutional effectiveness

3. **Tooling**:
   - Leverage AI assistants for violation detection
   - Integrate with existing code analysis tools
   - Automate reporting and tracking
   - Make compliance status visible
