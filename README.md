# Constitutional Development Template

This repository serves as a template for implementing Constitutional Development in software projects. Constitutional Development is an AI-friendly approach to software development that establishes a clear, natural-language set of principles and rules that govern all aspects of a codebase through a project constitution.

## What is Constitutional Development?

Constitutional Development is a software development methodology where a formal constitution serves as the supreme authority for all code decisions and system behaviors within a repository. This approach:

1. Establishes clear, foundational principles that guide development
2. Creates a consistent framework for decision-making
3. Ensures long-term maintainability and code quality
4. Provides explicit governance over documentation and architectural decisions

## How It Works

The heart of Constitutional Development is the project constitution. This document:

- Serves as the highest authority for all code and documentation
- Binds both human developers and AI assistants to its provisions
- Can be amended through a formal process designated by the repository maintainer
- Delegates specific governance to other key documents (ADRs, style guides, etc.)

## Benefits for AI-Assisted Development

Constitutional Development is particularly powerful when working with AI assistants because it:

1. **Provides Clear Boundaries**: AI assistants can reference explicit rules and principles when making decisions
2. **Ensures Consistency**: All changes, whether made by humans or AI, must adhere to the same constitutional framework
3. **Maintains Quality**: Constitutional provisions enforce high standards for code quality, documentation, and architectural decisions
4. **Reduces Ambiguity**: Clear constitutional guidelines help AI assistants make better decisions when faced with trade-offs

## Available Templates

### [Simple Template](templates/simple/)
A minimal constitution focused on core principles, perfect for getting started with Constitutional Development or building a custom governance structure. Features basic quality rules and a straightforward amendment process.

### [Constitution with History](templates/constitution-with-history/)
A comprehensive template that maintains a complete historical record of constitutional changes. Ideal for projects requiring formal amendment processes and governance auditability.

## Getting Started

To implement Constitutional Development in your project:

1. Choose a template that matches your needs:
   - `templates/simple/` - A minimal constitution focused on core principles, a good one to build upon.

2. Copy the chosen template to your project:
   - For simple template: Copy `templates/simple/constitution.md` to your project's root directory
   - For more complex templates: Copy the entire template directory structure as indicated in the template's documentation

3. Instruct your AI assistant to follow the constitution:
   ```
   Please follow the rules in the constitution.md file for all future interactions with this codebase.
   ```

4. Ask your AI assistant to review the constitution to ensure that it can see and interpret it correctly
