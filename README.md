# Constitutional Development Template

This repository serves as a template for implementing Constitutional Development in software projects. Constitutional Development is an AI-friendly approach to software development that establishes a clear, natural-language set of principles and rules that govern all aspects of a codebase through a project constitution.

## What is Constitutional Development?

Constitutional Development is a software development methodology where a formal constitution serves as the supreme authority for all code decisions and system behaviors within a repository. This approach:

1. Establishes clear, foundational principles that guide development
2. Creates a consistent framework for decision-making
3. Ensures long-term maintainability and code quality
4. Provides explicit governance over documentation and architectural decisions

## How It Works

The heart of Constitutional Development is the project constitution. This document:

- Serves as the highest authority for all code and documentation
- Binds both human developers and AI assistants to its provisions
- Can be amended through a formal process designated by the repository maintainer
- Delegates specific governance to other key documents (ADRs, style guides, etc.)

## Benefits for AI-Assisted Development

Constitutional Development is particularly powerful when working with AI assistants because it:

1. **Provides Clear Boundaries**: AI assistants can reference explicit rules and principles when making decisions
2. **Ensures Consistency**: All changes, whether made by humans or AI, must adhere to the same constitutional framework
3. **Maintains Quality**: Constitutional provisions enforce high standards for code quality, documentation, and architectural decisions
4. **Reduces Ambiguity**: Clear constitutional guidelines help AI assistants make better decisions when faced with trade-offs
