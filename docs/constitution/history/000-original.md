# Project Constitution

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and rules governing the repository in which it resides. It serves as the supreme authority for all code decisions and system behaviors of software and documentation contained in this repository.

### Section 1: Authority
1.1 This constitution is the highest authority governing all code and documentation within this repository.
1.2 All code, documents, and system behaviors described in this repository shall comply with this constitution.
1.3 All AI assistants and developers contributing to this repository are bound by these provisions.
1.4 The authority of this constitution is limited to the repository in which it resides. Processes and decisions made outside of this repository, including deployment, external testing apparatus, and any formal process for accepting amendments, shall be considered beyond the scope of this constitution.

### Section 2: Interpretation
2.1 AI assistants must interpret this constitution literally.
2.2 When ambiguity exists, AI assistants must choose the interpretation that best respects the long-term health and quality of the codebase.
2.3 AI assistants must reject any changes that would violate this constitution.
2.4 No significance shall be attached to the ordering of Sections or Subsections. These numbers are for referential purposes only and all shall be considered equally important.

### Section 3: Amendment Process
3.1 Amendments may be made to add or revise sections and subsections.
3.2 When a section is amended, the previous version becomes invalid.
3.3 The original constitutional document and all amendments shall be maintained at `/docs/constitution/history/`.
3.4 The original constitution shall be named `000-original.md`.
3.5 All other amendments shall be named `XXX-amendment-name.md` where `XXX` is the sequential number of the amendment.
3.6 The current, consolidated constitution shall be maintained at `/docs/constitution/constitution.md`.
3.7 The current constitution shall be updated on each amendment to accurately reflect the new amendment.
3.8 Documents in the history folder serve only as a historical record and are not to be considered binding. Only the current constitution referenced in subsection 3.6 is to be considered binding.
3.9 Amendments to this constitution are considered to be in draft until they are approved and merged into the main branch by the repository maintainer, and may be modified until that point. Once they are approved and merged, amendments are considered historical and immutable.

### Section 4: Documentation
4.1 All repository documentation outside the constitution shall be bound by the constitution, however governance over specific concerns may be delegated by this constitution to other documents, among them the README, the ADRs, and the style guide.
4.2 The README.md file, maintained at `/README.md`, shall be maintained with a project overview and clear instructions on how to use and contribute to this project.
4.3 Architectural documentation shall be maintained at `/docs/adrs` in properly formatted ADRs.
4.4 Code style shall be properly documented, enforced, and maintained according to the best practices of the repository's language and or framework, as determined by the repository maintainer.

### Section 5: Code Quality
5.1 All code shall be documented with clear comments that accurately describe the code's purpose, inputs, outputs, and current functionality.
5.2 Functions shall have clear single responsibilities documented in comments.
5.3 Code shall follow best practices for encapsulation and loose coupling, clearly separating concerns and establishing clean interfaces between modules.
