# Test-Driven Development Constitution

This template provides a language-agnostic constitution that enforces strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices when working with AI assistants. It ensures that the development process follows the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle fundamental to TDD.

## Purpose

The Test-Driven Development Constitution serves as a binding agreement between you and the AI assistant, requiring all development to follow TDD principles. This improves code quality, reduces bugs, and creates self-documenting code through comprehensive tests.

## How to Use This Constitution

1. **Include in Your Project**: Add the `constitution.md` file to the root of your project.

2. **Reference in Prompts**: When working with an AI assistant, reference this constitution in your requests:
   ```
   Please follow the Test-Driven Development Constitution in our repository for this task.
   ```

3. **Enforce the Process**: If the AI attempts to skip steps or write implementation code first, remind it to adhere to the constitution.

## TDD Workflow

The constitution enforces this specific workflow:

1. **Write Tests First**: Create tests that define expected behavior
2. **Run Tests (Expect Failure)**: Validate that tests properly fail
3. **Implement Minimal Code**: Write just enough code to make tests pass
4. **Verify Tests Pass**: Run tests again to confirm they now pass
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the implementation while ensuring tests continue to pass

## Benefits

- **Higher Quality Code**: TDD leads to more maintainable, modular code
- **Better Design**: Writing tests first encourages better API design
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation
- **Confidence**: Complete test coverage provides confidence when making changes
- **Reduced Debugging**: Catching issues early in the development cycle

## Example Prompt

When asking an AI assistant to implement a feature:

```
Please follow our Test-Driven Development Constitution when implementing this feature.

I need a function that validates email addresses. First, write comprehensive tests that 
check various valid and invalid email formats. Run these tests to show they fail, then 
implement the function to make the tests pass.
```

By following this constitution, all code produced by the AI assistant will be properly tested and verified.
