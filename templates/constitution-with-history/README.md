# Constitution with History Template

A robust constitutional template that maintains a complete historical record of all constitutional changes. This template is ideal for:

- Projects requiring formal amendment processes
- Teams that want to track constitutional evolution
- Codebases where governance changes need to be auditable
- Projects with multiple stakeholders or regulatory requirements

## Features

- Maintains full history of constitutional changes
- Formal amendment process with versioning
- Clear separation between current and historical documents
- Structured directory organization

## Directory Structure

```
constitution/
├── constitution.md           # Current binding constitution
└── history/                 # Historical record
    └── 000-original.md      # Original constitution
    └── XXX-amendment-name.md # Subsequent amendments
```

## Usage

1. Copy the current constitution to your project's root as `constitution.md`
2. Copy the `constitution` directory to your project's root
3. Review and customize the current constitution

## Amendment Process

1. Number amendments sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
